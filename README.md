Simple Site Based on a Infographic

I was browsing Reddit and found this [posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/mrxeet/figure_out_how_much_yarn_you_need_for_a_project/). It was a photo of a rough estimate in yards of how much yarn you would need for projects sorted by yarn weight (US Yarn Council scale). It was interesting but largely over simplified and a bit misleading. I wanted to do something similair but a little better and thought why not use the fact Ravely has an API and a large database of relaibale actual patterns to base it off of. 

So this is probably be a hosted site. Tentaively the tech stack is: 
Front-End: Angular 
Back-End: PHP, DB (TBD)
