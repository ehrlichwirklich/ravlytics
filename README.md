# Ravlytics

## Goal
JoAnn's had a oversimplified graphic talking about the relative yardage of craft projects. It can be viewed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/mrxeet/figure_out_how_much_yarn_you_need_for_a_project/). I thought it would be interesting to see the relative range of yarn weights on ravelry via their api.
